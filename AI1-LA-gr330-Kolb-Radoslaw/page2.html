        <h2>Top 5 Dark Souls 3 Bosses</h2> <!-- Podtytuł (H2) -->
        <p>The bosses in Dark Souls 3 are some of the most challenging and memorable encounters in gaming. Below is a ranking of the top 5 bosses, known for their difficulty, lore, and design.</p>

        <h3>1. Nameless King</h3> <!-- Ranking Bossów (H3) -->
        <p>The Nameless King is arguably the toughest boss in Dark Souls 3. As one of the optional bosses, players must go through multiple phases, including fighting the King of the Storm. His devastating lightning attacks and fast, unpredictable moves make him a nightmare for most players. The lore surrounding him is also deeply tied to the game’s hidden story, adding to his mystique.</p>

        <h3>2. Slave Knight Gael</h3>
        <p>Gael, the final boss of the "Ringed City" DLC, offers a challenging yet emotional battle. His fight is an epic conclusion to the Dark Souls series, with multiple phases and brutal attacks. Gael’s role in the lore, as a warrior seeking the Dark Soul of Man, makes his battle even more impactful.</p>

        <h3>3. Pontiff Sulyvahn</h3>
        <p>Pontiff Sulyvahn serves as a major roadblock for many players. His relentless dual-wielding attacks and the summoning of his shadow clone create a chaotic and difficult battle. Sulyvahn's place in Lothric's political and religious hierarchy further deepens his role in the game.</p>

        <h3>4. Sister Friede</h3>
        <p>Sister Friede is the final boss of the "Ashes of Ariandel" DLC. This multi-phase battle against Friede and Father Ariandel challenges players with her quick movements and devastating scythe attacks. Her connection to the Painted World and her role in maintaining the balance adds depth to her fight.</p>

        <h3>5. Lothric, Younger Prince</h3>
        <p>The battle against Lothric and his brother, Lorian, is one of the more story-driven encounters. The fight requires players to manage two enemies at once, with Lorian’s teleporting strikes and Lothric's healing abilities creating a tough and strategic encounter.</p>
